# Quirkles

## Who am I?
A software developer from toronto. I like to build small apps, libraries,
scripts, and i host them here. 

Many things here are incomplete or half working and I may or may not come back
to them, I just keep things here as habit now.

## What is this?

An nx based monorepo containing many of my libraries and projects. The primary
reason for this monorepo to exist is the react conponent library, QDS, which
I intend to build out to make it easier to scaffold frontend applications.
There is also the advantage of nx generators, making it easy to spin up front
end projects with a css theme set up.
